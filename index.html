    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Divita Miglani, a passionate student with a keen interest in cyber security and a budding hacker in the making. As technology continues to evolve, so does the need for individuals who can protect it. With a strong foundation in cyber security principles and a hunger for knowledge, I'm dedicated to honing my skills and contributing to a safer digital world.
      Throughout my journey, I've delved into various aspects of cyber security, from understanding the fundamentals of network security to exploring the intricacies of ethical hacking. My curiosity drives me to constantly seek out new challenges and opportunities to learn, whether it's dissecting malware samples or participating in Capture The Flag competitions.
      This portfolio serves as a testament to my passion for cyber security and showcases my projects, achievements, and expertise. Feel free to explore and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or discuss anything related to cyber security!</p>
